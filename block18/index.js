// Unit test specifications should take the form of:

//     Expect [action] to be [some result]
//     Example: For the prompt "A function called "addition" that returns the sum of two input integers", your tests might include:
//         Expect addition(2, 3) to be a number
//         Expect addition(2, 3) to be equal to 5
//         Expect addition("a", 3) to be an error
